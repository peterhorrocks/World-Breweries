# World Breweries API Project #

This is my contirbution to the UDEMY course project, **The Complete Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, Capstone Project - Use a Public API**.

This is also my first attempt at a README.md file using Markdown language, so forgive me if I get a few things wrong.

My four passions in life are programming, beer, hiking and biology/zoology. This project covers the first 2. I intend to tackle the others in upcoming projects.

This project uses the **Open Brewery DB API**, and provides you with various options to view the data.

You can view the documentation and required /endpoints at <a href="https://www.openbrewerydb.org/">**Open Brewery DB**</a>

## Download ##

You are welcome to download and install on you computer, and amend the code as you wish.

Extract the zip file, and copy the extracted folder under an **empty project** folder of your choice.

## Installing Node ##

This is a **server-side** application, and you will have needed to installed **Node.js** on your computer.

If you do not already have **Node.js** installed, see <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">**Node JS**</a> for instructions.

## Installing the required Node Modules ##

This project uses the **axios**, **express**, **ejs** and **body-parser** node modules, so these will need to be installed.

Open a **terminal** in your Code Editor; I am using VS Code, but most IDEs should be similar.

In the **command line**, make sure that you are in your project directory.

1.  Run **npm init** to initialise and create the **package.json** file.

2.  Edit the **package.json** file, and include the entry **"type": "module",** under the "description". Save the file.

3.  Next, run **npm install axios** or **npm i axios**. This will create a folder **node_modules** in your project folder, and install the axios module.

4.  Do this for the **express**, **ejs** and **body-parser** node modules. These will automatically be included in the packag.json file under **"dependencies".**

## Running the Package ##

1.  From the **command line**, run **node index.js**, or **nodemon index.js** if you have nodemon installed.

2.  In your **browser**, type in the address bar **localhost:3000**.

3.  And away we go!

## Contributions ##

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project and give me new ideas.
